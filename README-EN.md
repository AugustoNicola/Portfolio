<br>

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, in which I present information about my aptitudes and experience. Made with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.

The design is heavily based off [Ram Maheshwari's](https://github.com/rammcodes) own portfolio template, ["Dopefolio"](https://github.com/rammcodes/Dopefolio).

The icons used throughout the project are property of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

# Instalación y Uso Local
In order to locally edit the website, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository and move to the target directory**
	
		$ git clone https://github.com/AugustoNicola/Portfolio
		$ cd Portfolio/

2. **Install the necessary dependencies (i.e. `node-sass`)**
		
		$ npm run install-all-dependencies

That's it, the project should be ready to use! In order to compile and use modifications made to the SCSS files, either the [Live SASS extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) or the `npm run build` can be used.

<br>

## Commands

* `npm run build`: Reads all files inside the `scss` directory and compiles them into `css/main.css` to be used by the static files.
